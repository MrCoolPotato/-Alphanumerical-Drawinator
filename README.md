# 🚀 Alphanumerical DRAWINATOR 🚀

![Gameplay](gameplay.png)

Welcome to **DRAWINATOR**, a fun and engaging game where you shoot down enemies with alphanumeric bullets! This game is built using Python and the Pygame library.

## 🎮 How to Play

Use the left and right arrow keys to move your gun. Press the space bar to shoot bullets. Each bullet is assigned a random character from alphanumericals.

When the game is paused, a "PAUSED" text will appear in the center of the screen. Press 'P' to pause and unpause the game.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multishot**: After defeating a boss, you gain the ability to shoot multiple bullets at once for a short period of time.
